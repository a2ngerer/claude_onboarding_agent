## Memory files

- `CLAUDE.md` — project instructions at `./CLAUDE.md` or `./.claude/CLAUDE.md`; user-level at `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`. Loaded into every session.
- `CLAUDE.local.md` — personal project notes; gitignored, appended after `CLAUDE.md`.
- `AGENTS.md` — not read natively by Claude Code. If the repo needs both, `CLAUDE.md` imports it with `@AGENTS.md` (or symlink `ln -s AGENTS.md CLAUDE.md` outside Windows).
- Size target: keep each `CLAUDE.md` under ~200 lines. Longer files reduce adherence.
- For modular rules, use `.claude/rules/*.md` with optional `paths:` frontmatter to scope by glob. Rules without `paths:` load unconditionally; the directory supports symlinks to share rules across projects.
- Imports: `@path/to/file` inside `CLAUDE.md` pulls another file into context at launch (max depth 4).

## Auto memory

- Separate from `CLAUDE.md`: Claude writes its own notes based on your corrections and discoveries, without being asked. On by default; toggle with `/memory` or `autoMemoryEnabled` in settings.
- Storage: `~/.claude/projects/<project>/memory/`, shared across worktrees of the same repo. `MEMORY.md` is the index (first 200 lines / 25KB loaded every session); topic files load on demand.
- Edit or delete anything in it at any time — it's plain markdown, browsable via `/memory`.

## Settings

Top-level keys in `.claude/settings.json`: `permissions`, `env`, `hooks`, `mcpServers`, `model`, `agent`, `outputStyle`, `sandbox`, `claudeMdExcludes`, `fallbackModel`, `requiredMinimumVersion`, `enforceAvailableModels`. Permission rules evaluate in order `deny → ask → allow`; first match wins.

```json
{ "permissions": { "allow": ["Bash(npm run test *)"], "deny": ["Read(./.env)"] } }
```

- **`fallbackModel`** — model to use when the primary `model` is unavailable or rate-limited.
- **`requiredMinimumVersion`** — semver string; Claude Code refuses to run if the installed version is older.
- **`enforceAvailableModels`** — boolean; when `true`, rejects model IDs not available in the current account/tier at startup rather than failing at runtime.

**Safe mode:** Set `CLAUDE_CODE_SAFE_MODE=1` in the environment to disable CLAUDE.md loading, plugins, skills, hooks, and MCP servers. Useful for security-sensitive CI environments or troubleshooting a broken config.

## Hooks

| Event | Typical use | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `SessionStart` | Load context or env vars on session open | Inject current git branch |
| `InstructionsLoaded` | React to what triggered loading (new session, `/reload-skills`, plugin install); inspect `load_reason` | Log which skills were loaded |
| `UserPromptSubmit` | Validate or enrich the user prompt | Block secret patterns |
| `PreToolUse` | Block or gate a tool call | Deny `Bash(rm -rf *)` |
| `PostToolUse` | Lint or log after a tool runs | Auto-run `eslint --fix` after `Edit` |
| `PostToolBatch` | React after a full parallel tool batch completes | Summarize a batch of file reads |
| `MessageDisplay` | Intercept or annotate a message before it is shown | Inject a reminder banner |
| `PreCompact` | Save state before context compaction | Checkpoint session notes |
| `PostCompact` | Re-inject context after compaction | Reload pinned snippets |
| `WorktreeCreate` | Set up a fresh worktree (install deps, copy env) | `npm ci` in the new branch |
| `WorktreeRemove` | Clean up after a worktree is deleted | Remove temp build artifacts |
| `Stop` | Cleanup when Claude finishes a turn | Persist session notes |
| `SessionEnd` | Release resources or save artifacts | Flush metrics |

Hooks live in `.claude/settings.json` under `hooks.<EventName>[]` with a `matcher` and a list of `{ type, command }` entries. Plugins ship hooks in `hooks/hooks.json`. Newer events not in the table above: `SubagentStart`/`SubagentStop` (agent lifecycle), `PermissionRequest`/`PermissionDenied` (auto-mode classifier), `ConfigChange`, `TaskCreated`/`TaskCompleted`, `Notification`, `Elicitation` — see the official hooks reference for the full current list.

## Slash commands

- Custom commands have merged into skills: `.claude/commands/deploy.md` and `.claude/skills/deploy/SKILL.md` both create `/deploy` and behave the same; legacy `.claude/commands/*.md` files still work. Project skills live at `.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`; user skills at `~/.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`.
- Plugin-provided skills are namespaced: `/<plugin-name>:<skill-name>` to prevent collisions.
- Arguments: `$ARGUMENTS` (full string), `$0`/`$1`/… or `$ARGUMENTS[N]` (positional), named args via `arguments:` frontmatter.
- Name slugs: lowercase letters, digits, hyphens only; max 64 chars.
- `/reload-skills` — hot-reload skill/command files without restarting the session.
- `/cd <path>` — change the working directory for the current session.
- `/plugin list` — list installed plugins and their status.
- `claude agents` — list all available named subagents (CLI).

## SKILL.md frontmatter fields

| Field | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `argument-hint` | Short placeholder shown in autocomplete (e.g. `[branch]`) |
| `allowed-tools` | Comma-separated tool whitelist for this skill's invocation |
| `model` | Override model for this skill (accepts aliases: `fable`, `opus`, `sonnet`, `haiku`, `inherit`) |
| `effort` | `low` / `normal` / `high` — hint to the model's thinking budget |
| `context: fork` | Run the skill in a forked context (isolated from main conversation) |
| `context: agent` | Run the skill as a full subagent turn |
| `paths` | Glob list — load this skill only when CWD matches |
| `disable-model-invocation` | `true` — skill runs its command without calling the model (pure automation) |
| `user-invocable` | `false` — hides the skill from `/` autocomplete; only callable programmatically |

## Plugins

- Manifest: `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` with `name`, `version` (semver), `description`, optional `author`, `homepage`, `repository`, `displayName`, `defaultEnabled`, `dependencies`.
  - `displayName` — human-readable name shown in the marketplace and `/plugin list`.
  - `defaultEnabled` — boolean; whether the plugin activates on install without user opt-in.
  - `dependencies` — list of other plugin names that must be installed for this plugin to function.
- Components sit at the plugin root, not inside `.claude-plugin/`: `skills/`, `agents/`, `commands/`, `hooks/`, `.mcp.json`, `.lsp.json`, `monitors/`, `settings.json`, `bin/` (executables added to the Bash tool's `PATH`).
- Version every release; users update through the marketplace. `/reload-plugins` picks up local edits.
- `claude plugin init <name>` scaffolds a plugin under `~/.claude/skills/<name>/` so it auto-loads without a marketplace or install step (not just "the current directory").

## Recommendations

- Point-don't-dump in `CLAUDE.md`: keep it short and reference detail files via `@imports` or `.claude/rules/`.
- Prefer skills (`SKILL.md`) over fat `CLAUDE.md` sections for anything longer than a few bullets or invoked only sometimes.
- Use a `PostToolUse` hook to run linters or formatters after `Write`/`Edit` instead of instructing Claude to do it.
- Scope permissions explicitly: allowlist safe commands (`Bash(npm run test *)`), deny reads of secrets (`Read(./.env)`).
- Pin plugin versions in team repos; run `/reload-plugins` after edits instead of restarting; namespace plugin skills rather than relying on a collision-prone flat name.

## Deprecated patterns

- Do not stuff templates, multi-step procedures, or tool references into `CLAUDE.md` — move them into `skills/` or `.claude/rules/`.
- Do not place `commands/`, `agents/`, `skills/`, or `hooks/` inside `.claude-plugin/`; only `plugin.json` belongs there.
- Do not rely on `AGENTS.md` being read directly by Claude Code — import it from `CLAUDE.md` with `@AGENTS.md`.
- Do not use legacy `.claude/commands/*.md` for new functionality — prefer `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` so supporting files and frontmatter are available.
- Do not silently overwrite an existing `CLAUDE.md` — extend with a delimited, attributed section.
